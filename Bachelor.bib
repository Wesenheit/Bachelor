            This is the second of a series of papers that focuses on searching large sets of photometric light curves for evidence of close binaries with a dormant black hole, and, in some cases, a dormant neutron star. The detection of such a binary is based on identifying a star that displays a large ellipsoidal periodic modulation, induced by tidal interaction with its companion. Based on the observed ellipsoidal amplitude and the primary mass and radius, one can derive a minimum mass ratio of the binary. A binary with a minimum mass ratio significantly larger than unity might be a candidate for having a dormant compact-object companion. Unfortunately, the photometric search is hampered by the fact that in many cases the primary mass and radius are not well known. In this paper we present a simple approach that circumvents this problem by suggesting a robust modified minimum mass ratio, assuming the primary fills its Roche lobe. The newly defined modified minimum mass ratio is always smaller than the minimum mass ratio, which is, in its turn, smaller than the actual mass ratio. Therefore, binaries with a modified minimum mass ratio larger than unity are candidates for having a compact-object secondary.},

            Ellipsoidal variables present light-curve modulations caused by stellar distortion, induced by tidal interaction with their companions. An analytical approximated model of the ellipsoidal modulation is given as a discrete Fourier series by Morris \& Naftilan. Based on numerical simulations using the phoebe code, we present here updated amplitudes of the first three harmonics of the model. The expected amplitudes are given as a function of the mass ratio and inclination of the binary system and the fillout factor of the primary – the ratio between the stellar radius and that of its Roche lobe. The corrections can get up to 30 per cent relative to the Morris \& Naftilan model for fillout factors close to unity. The updated model can be instrumental in searching for short-period binaries with compact-object secondaries in large data sets of photometric light curves. As shown in one OGLE light-curve example, the minimum mass ratio can be obtained by using only the amplitudes of the three harmonics and an estimation of the stellar temperature. High enough amplitudes can help to identify binaries with mass ratios larger than unity, some of which might have compact companions.},

            This is the third of a series of papers that presents an algorithm to search for close binaries with massive, possibly compact, unseen secondaries. The detection of such a binary is based on identifying a star that displays a large ellipsoidal periodic modulation, induced by tidal interaction with its companion. In the second paper of the series, we presented a simple approach to derive a robust modified minimum mass ratio (mMMR), based on the observed ellipsoidal amplitude, without knowing the primary mass and radius, assuming the primary fills its Roche lobe. The newly defined mMMR is always smaller than the actual mass ratio. Therefore, a binary with an mMMR larger than unity is a good candidate for having a massive secondary, which might be a black hole or a neutron star. This paper considers 10 956 OGLE short-period ellipsoidals observed towards the Galactic bulge. We re-analyse their modulation and identify 136 main-sequence systems with mMMR significantly larger than unity as candidates for having compact-object secondaries, assuming their observed periodic modulations reflect indeed the ellipsoidal effect. Obviously, one needs follow-up observations to find out the true nature of these companions.},

            We analyse two binary systems containing giant stars, V723 Mon (‘the Unicorn’) and 2M04123153+6738486 (‘the Giraffe’). Both giants orbit more massive but less luminous companions, previously proposed to be mass-gap black holes. Spectral disentangling reveals luminous companions with star-like spectra in both systems. Joint modelling of the spectra, light curves, and spectral energy distributions robustly constrains the masses, temperatures, and radii of both components: the primaries are luminous, cool giants (\$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff,{\textbackslash}, giant\} = 3800\$ and \$4000{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm K\$, \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm giant\}= 22.5\$ and \$25{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) with exceptionally low masses (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm giant\} {\textbackslash}approx 0.4{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) that likely fill their Roche lobes. The secondaries are only slightly warmer subgiants (\$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff,{\textbackslash}, 2\} = 5800\$ and \$5150{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm K\$, \$R\_2= 8.3\$ and \$9{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$) and thus are consistent with observed UV limits that would rule out main-sequence stars with similar masses (\$M\_2 {\textbackslash}approx 2.8\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}approx\}1.8{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$). In the Unicorn, rapid rotation blurs the spectral lines of the subgiant, making it challenging to detect even at wavelengths where it dominates the total light. Both giants have surface abundances indicative of CNO processing and subsequent envelope stripping. The properties of both systems can be reproduced by binary evolution models in which a \$1\{-\}2{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ primary is stripped by a companion as it ascends the giant branch. The fact that the companions are also evolved implies either that the initial mass ratio was very near unity, or that the companions are temporarily inflated due to rapid accretion. The Unicorn and Giraffe offer a window into into a rarely observed phase of binary evolution preceding the formation of wide-orbit helium white dwarfs, and eventually, compact binaries containing two helium white dwarfs.},

            The third data release of the Gaia mission includes orbital solutions for \&gt;105 single-lined spectroscopic binaries, representing more than an order of magnitude increase in sample size over all previous studies. This data set is a treasure trove for searches for quiescent black hole + normal star binaries. We investigate one population of black hole candidate binaries highlighted in the data release: sources near the main sequence in the colour–magnitude diagram (CMD) with dynamically inferred companion masses M2 larger than the CMD-inferred mass of the luminous star. We model light curves, spectral energy distributions, and archival spectra of the 14 such objects in DR3 with high-significance orbital solutions and inferred \$M\_2 {\textbackslash}gt 3{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$. We find that 100 per cent of these sources are mass-transfer binaries containing a highly stripped lower giant donor (0.2 ≲ M/M⊙ ≲ 0.4) and much more massive (2 ≲ M/M⊙ ≲ 2.5) main-sequence accretor. The Gaia orbital solutions are for the donors, which contribute about half the light in the Gaia RVS bandpass but only \${\textbackslash}lesssim 20\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ in the g band. The accretors’ broad spectral features likely prevented the sources from being classified as double-lined. The donors are all close to Roche lobe filling (\$R/R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Roche{\textbackslash}, lobe\}{\textbackslash}gt 0.8\$), but modelling suggests that a majority are detached (\$R/R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm Roche{\textbackslash}, lobe\}{\textbackslash}lt 1\$). Binary evolution models predict that these systems will soon become detached helium white dwarf + main-sequence ‘EL CVn’ binaries. Our investigation highlights both the power of Gaia data for selecting interesting subpopulations of binaries and the ways in which binary evolution can bamboozle standard CMD-based stellar-mass estimates.},

            We report the discovery of the closest known black hole candidate as a binary companion to V723 Mon. V723 Mon is a nearby (\$d{\textbackslash}sim 460{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm pc\$), bright (V ≃ 8.3 mag), evolved (Teff, giant ≃ 4440 K, and Lgiant ≃ 173 L⊙) red giant in a high mass function, f(M) = 1.72 ± 0.01 M⊙, nearly circular binary (P = 59.9 d, e ≃ 0). V723 Mon is a known variable star, previously classified as an eclipsing binary, but its All-Sky Automated Survey, Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curves are those of a nearly edge-on ellipsoidal variable. Detailed models of the light curves constrained by the period, radial velocities, and stellar temperature give an inclination of \$87.0{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ {\textasciicircum}\{+1.7{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \}\}\_\{-1.4{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \}\$, a mass ratio of q ≃ 0.33 ± 0.02, a companion mass of Mcomp = 3.04 ± 0.06 M⊙, a stellar radius of Rgiant = 24.9 ± 0.7 R⊙, and a giant mass of Mgiant = 1.00 ± 0.07 M⊙. We identify a likely non-stellar, diffuse veiling component with contributions in the B and V band of \$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}63\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}24\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$, respectively. The SED and the absence of continuum eclipses imply that the companion mass must be dominated by a compact object. We do observe eclipses of the Balmer lines when the dark companion passes behind the giant, but their velocity spreads are low compared to observed accretion discs. The X-ray luminosity of the system is \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textbackslash}simeq 7.6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{29\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm ergs{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, corresponding to L/Ledd ∼ 10−9. The simplest explanation for the massive companion is a single compact object, most likely a black hole in the ‘mass gap’.},

	abstract = {We point out that stars within a fairly large range of masses, roughly 18-30 Msun, can both explode as supernovae (and give off neutrinos as observed in SN 1987A) and then go into black holes. The masses of the black holes so formed are only slightly above 1.5 Msun, the maximum mass for compact cores, according to our arguments. These masses are substantially smaller than those of the best candidates for black holes observed thus far. We discuss the possibility that SN 1987A produced one of these small black holes. We review the requirements that observed nucleosynthesis puts on theoretical nucleosynthesis. Especially the empirical value of ΔY/ΔZ = 4±1.3 gives a sensitive determination of the mass at which nucleosynthesis must be cut off, by heavier stars collapsing into black holes without returning matter to the Galaxy, because otherwise heavy stars would produce chiefly metals and unduly lower the calculated value of A Y/AZ. We arrive at a value of Mcutoff = 25±5 Msun for the mass at which nucleosynthesis must be cut off. We show that the introduction of kaon condensation sufficiently softens the equation of state of dense matter, so that compact cores of mass greater than Mmax ≃Msun will not be stable. For the first ≳12 s, however, compact cores up to ∼1.84 Msun are stabilized; this gives the nucleosynthesis mass cutoff as ∼30 Msun, at the upper end of our limit from nucleosynthetic demands. Our soft equation of state extends black hole production to stars of lower mass than previously estimated, and, therefore, increases the estimated number of black holes by an order of magnitude or more, to ∼109 in the Galaxy.},

            We report discovery of a bright, nearby (\$G = 13.8;{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}, d = 480{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm pc\$) Sun-like star orbiting a dark object. We identified the system as a black hole candidate via its astrometric orbital solution from the Gaia mission. Radial velocities validated and refined the Gaia solution, and spectroscopy ruled out significant light contributions from another star. Joint modelling of radial velocities and astrometry constrains the companion mass of \$M\_2 = 9.62{\textbackslash}pm 0.18{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$. The spectroscopic orbit alone sets a minimum companion mass of \$M\_2{\textbackslash}gt 5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$; if the companion were a \$5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ star, it would be 500 times more luminous than the entire system. These constraints are insensitive to the mass of the luminous star, which appears as a slowly rotating G dwarf (\$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}=5850{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm K\$, log g = 4.5, \$M=0.93{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$), with near-solar metallicity (\${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H] = -0.2\$) and an unremarkable abundance pattern. We find no plausible astrophysical scenario that can explain the orbit and does not involve a black hole. The orbital period, Porb = 185.6 d, is longer than that of any known stellar-mass black hole binary. The system’s modest eccentricity (e = 0.45), high metallicity, and thin-disc Galactic orbit suggest that it was born in the Milky Way disc with at most a weak natal kick. How the system formed is uncertain. Common envelope evolution can only produce the system’s wide orbit under extreme and likely unphysical assumptions. Formation models involving triples or dynamical assembly in an open cluster may be more promising. This is the nearest known black hole by a factor of 3, and its discovery suggests the existence of a sizable population of dormant black holes in binaries. Future Gaia releases will likely facilitate the discovery of dozens more.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            We report the discovery of the closest known black hole candidate as a binary companion to V723 Mon. V723 Mon is a nearby (\$d{\textbackslash}sim 460{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm pc\$), bright (V ≃ 8.3 mag), evolved (Teff, giant ≃ 4440 K, and Lgiant ≃ 173 L⊙) red giant in a high mass function, f(M) = 1.72 ± 0.01 M⊙, nearly circular binary (P = 59.9 d, e ≃ 0). V723 Mon is a known variable star, previously classified as an eclipsing binary, but its All-Sky Automated Survey, Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curves are those of a nearly edge-on ellipsoidal variable. Detailed models of the light curves constrained by the period, radial velocities, and stellar temperature give an inclination of \$87.0{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ {\textasciicircum}\{+1.7{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \}\}\_\{-1.4{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ \}\$, a mass ratio of q ≃ 0.33 ± 0.02, a companion mass of Mcomp = 3.04 ± 0.06 M⊙, a stellar radius of Rgiant = 24.9 ± 0.7 R⊙, and a giant mass of Mgiant = 1.00 ± 0.07 M⊙. We identify a likely non-stellar, diffuse veiling component with contributions in the B and V band of \$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}63\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ and \$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}24\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$, respectively. The SED and the absence of continuum eclipses imply that the companion mass must be dominated by a compact object. We do observe eclipses of the Balmer lines when the dark companion passes behind the giant, but their velocity spreads are low compared to observed accretion discs. The X-ray luminosity of the system is \$L\_\{{\textbackslash}rm X\}{\textbackslash}simeq 7.6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{29\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm ergs{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, corresponding to L/Ledd ∼ 10−9. The simplest explanation for the massive companion is a single compact object, most likely a black hole in the ‘mass gap’.},

              We report the first unambiguous detection and mass measurement of an isolated stellar-mass black hole (BH). We used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to carry out precise astrometry of the source star of the long-duration (
              t
              E
              ≃ 270 days), high-magnification microlensing event MOA-2011-BLG-191/OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 (hereafter designated as MOA-11-191/OGLE-11-462), in the direction of the Galactic bulge. HST imaging, conducted at eight epochs over an interval of 6 yr, reveals a clear relativistic astrometric deflection of the background star’s apparent position. Ground-based photometry of MOA-11-191/OGLE-11-462 shows a parallactic signature of the effect of Earth’s motion on the microlensing light curve. Combining the HST astrometry with the ground-based light curve and the derived parallax, we obtain a lens mass of 7.1 ± 1.3
              M
              ⊙
              and a distance of 1.58 ± 0.18 kpc. We show that the lens emits no detectable light, which, along with having a mass higher than is possible for a white dwarf or neutron star, confirms its BH nature. Our analysis also provides an absolute proper motion for the BH. The proper motion is offset from the mean motion of Galactic disk stars at similar distances by an amount corresponding to a transverse space velocity of ∼45  km s
              −1
              , suggesting that the BH received a “natal kick” from its supernova explosion. Previous mass determinations for stellar-mass BHs have come from radial velocity measurements of Galactic X-ray binaries and from gravitational radiation emitted by merging BHs in binary systems in external galaxies. Our mass measurement is the first for an isolated stellar-mass BH using any technique.},

              We present the second
              Gaia
              data release,
              Gaia
              DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.
            
            
              Aims.
              A summary of the contents of
              Gaia
              DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to
              Gaia
              DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of
              Gaia
              DR2 results.
            
            
              Methods.
              The raw data collected with the
              Gaia
              instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the
              Gaia
              Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to
              Gaia
              DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products.
              Results. Gaia
              DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in
              G
              for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the
              G
              BP
              (330–680 nm) and
              G
              RP
              (630–1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally,
              Gaia
              DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the
              Gaia
              -CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to
              Gaia
              DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.
              Conclusions. Gaia
              DR2 represents a major achievement for the
              Gaia
              mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the
              Gaia
              survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

The GDR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. The GDR3 catalogue contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and broad band photometry in the G, G\$\_\{BP\}\$, and G\$\_\{RP\}\$ pass-bands already present in the Early Third Data Release. GDR3 introduces an impressive wealth of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges \$G\_\{rvs\} \&lt; 14\$ and \$3100},

The VHS vision includes a deep optical survey over the same area and this is now being realised with the VST surveys and the Dark Energy Survey, which has recently started.

	abstract = {We are performing a uniform and unbiased imaging survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; {\textasciitilde}7deg×7deg) using the IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 μm) and MIPS (24, 70, and 160 μm) instruments on board the Spitzer Space Telescope in the Surveying the Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution (SAGE) survey, these agents being the interstellar medium (ISM) and stars in the LMC. This paper provides an overview of the SAGE Legacy project, including observing strategy, data processing, and initial results. Three key science goals determined the coverage and depth of the survey. The detection of diffuse ISM with column densities {\textgreater}1.2×1021 H cm-2 permits detailed studies of dust processes in the ISM. SAGE's point-source sensitivity enables a complete census of newly formed stars with masses {\textgreater}3 Msolar that will determine the current star formation rate in the LMC. SAGE's detection of evolved stars with mass-loss rates {\textgreater}1×10-8 Msolar yr-1 will quantify the rate at which evolved stars inject mass into the ISM of the LMC. The observing strategy includes two epochs in 2005, separated by 3 months, that both mitigate instrumental artifacts and constrain source variability. The SAGE data are nonproprietary. The data processing includes IRAC and MIPS pipelines and a database for mining the point-source catalogs, which will be released to the community in support of Spitzer proposal cycles 4 and 5. We present initial results on the epoch 1 data for a region near N79 and N83. The MIPS 70 and 160 μm images of the diffuse dust emission of the N79/N83 region reveal a similar distribution to the gas emissions, especially the H I 21 cm emission. The measured point-source sensitivity for the epoch 1 data is consistent with expectations for the survey. The point-source counts are highest for the IRAC 3.6 μm band and decrease dramatically toward longer wavelengths, consistent with the fact that stars dominate the point-source catalogs and the dusty objects detected at the longer wavelengths are rare in comparison. The SAGE epoch 1 point-source catalog has {\textasciitilde}4×106 sources, and more are anticipated when the epoch 1 and 2 data are combined. Using Milky Way (MW) templates as a guide, we adopt a simplified point-source classification to identify three candidate groups-stars without dust, dusty evolved stars, and young stellar objects-that offer a starting point for this work. We outline a strategy for identifying foreground MW stars, which may comprise as much as 18\% of the source list, and background galaxies, which may comprise {\textasciitilde}12\% of the source list.},

              We present the first data release of the SkyMapper Southern Survey, a hemispheric survey carried out with the SkyMapper Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.

	abstract = {This catalogue is the latest incremental release of the DENIS project. It consists of a set of 355,220,325 point sources detected by the DENIS survey in 3662 strips (covering each 30 degrees in declination and 12 arcmin in right ascension). The data in this release cover approximately 16700 square degrees of the Southern sky. Multiple detections of single point sources have been merged in image overlaps within individual strips, but sources can have multiple detections in overlaping strips. DENIS is the only astronomical survey of the Southern sky made in two near-infrared bands (J at 1.25μm, and Ks at 2.15μm) and one optical band (Gunn-i at 0.82μm), with limiting magnitudes 16.5, 14 and 18.5, respectively. Saturation magnitudes are Ks=6, J=7.5 and Gunn-i=9.8mag. It was conducted by a European consortium, using the 1m telescope at ESO, La Silla (Chile). The DENIS instrument is made up of a 3-channel camera built of commercially available detector arrays by the Observatoire de Paris and with major contributions from other European Institutes, notably: the IAS in Frascati, the Observatoire de Grenoble, the University of Innsbruck, the Observatoire de Lyon, and the IAC in Tenerife. The survey is carried out by observing strips of 30° in declination and 12arcminutes in Right Ascension with an overlap of 2 arcminutes between consecutive strips. The survey started at the end of 1995 and has been completed up to 97\% in 2001. The data have been reduced at the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris and Observatoire de Paris. The position of a general extracted point source is provided with an accuracy better than 1arcsec and its magnitude to better than 0.1 mag. The Centre de Donnees Astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS) is releasing the final databases and provides access of the processed and calibrated data to the worldwide community. The principal investigator of the DENIS project is N. Epchtein (Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur); the Co-PI in charge of data processing is G. Simon (observatoire de Paris); J. Borsenberger and B. de Batz, with the help of F. Tanguy, S. Begon and P. Texier, processed the data and implemented the working data base at PDAC; S. Derriere is in charge of the data release at CDS. Scientists and engineers from seven European countries and from Brazil are involved in the data qualification and analysis. (1 data file).},

	abstract = {Inferences about the spatial density or phase-space structure of stellar populations in the Milky Way require a precise determination of the effective survey volume. The volume observed by surveys such as Gaia or near-infrared spectroscopic surveys, which have good coverage of the Galactic mid-plane region, is highly complex because of the abundant small-scale structure in the three-dimensional interstellar dust extinction. We introduce a novel framework for analyzing the importance of small-scale structure in the extinction. This formalism demonstrates that the spatially-complex effect of extinction on the selection function of a pencil-beam or contiguous sky survey is equivalent to a low-pass filtering of the extinction-affected selection function with the smooth density field. We find that the angular resolution of current 3D extinction maps is sufficient for analyzing Gaia sub-samples of millions of stars. However, the current distance resolution is inadequate and needs to be improved by an order of magnitude, especially in the inner Galaxy. We also present a practical and efficient method for properly taking the effect of extinction into account in analyses of Galactic structure through an effective selection function. We illustrate its use with the selection function of red-clump stars in APOGEE using and comparing a variety of current 3D extinction maps.},

The survey covers over 3000 square degrees in the sky and monitors regularly over a billion sources. The main targets include the inner Galactic Bulge and the Magellanic System. Their photometry spans the range of \$12{\textless}I{\textless}21\$ mag and \$13{\textless}I{\textless}21.7\$ mag, respectively. Supplementary shallower Galaxy Variability Survey covers the extended Galactic bulge and 2/3 of the whole Galactic disk within the magnitude range of \$10{\textless}I{\textless}19\$ mag. All OGLE-IV surveys provide photometry with milli-magnitude accuracy at the bright end. The cadence of observations varies from 19-60 minutes in the inner Galactic bulge to 1-3 days in the remaining Galactic bulge fields, Magellanic System and the Galactic disk. OGLE-IV provides the astronomical community with a number of real time services. The Early Warning System (EWS) contains information on two thousand gravitational microlensing events being discovered in real time annually, the OGLE Transient Detection System (OTDS) delivers over 200 supernovae a year. We also provide the real time photometry of unpredictable variables such as optical counterparts to the X-ray sources and R CrB stars. Hundreds of thousands new variable stars have already been discovered and classified by the OGLE survey. The number of new detections will be at least doubled during the current OGLE-IV phase. The survey was designed and optimized primarily to conduct the second generation microlensing survey for exoplanets. It has already contributed significantly to the increase of the discovery rate of microlensing exoplanets and free-floating planets.},

	abstract = {We report spectroscopic and photometric follow-up of a dormant black hole (BH) candidate from Gaia DR3. We show that the system, which we call Gaia BH2, contains a \${\textbackslash}sim 1M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ red giant and a dark companion with mass \$M\_2 = 8.9{\textbackslash}pm 0.3{\textbackslash},M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ that is very likely a BH. The orbital period, \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm orb\} = 1277\$ days, is much longer than that of any previously studied BH binary. Our radial velocity (RV) follow-up over a 6-month period spans most of the orbit's dynamic range in RV and is in excellent agreement with predictions of the Gaia solution. UV imaging and high-resolution optical spectra rule out all plausible luminous companions that could explain the orbit. The star is a bright (\$G=12.3\$), slightly metal-poor (\${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]=-0.22\$) low-luminosity giant (\$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}=4600{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm K\$; \$R = 7.9{\textbackslash},R\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$; \${\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}left[g/{\textbackslash}left(\{{\textbackslash}rm cm{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\}{\textbackslash}right){\textbackslash}right] = 2.6\$). The binary's orbit is moderately eccentric (\$e=0.52\$). The giant is strongly enhanced in \${\textbackslash}alpha-\$elements, with \${\textbackslash}rm [{\textbackslash}alpha/Fe] = +0.26\$, but the system's Galactocentric orbit is typical of the thin disk. We obtained X-ray and radio nondetections of the source near periastron, which support BH accretion models in which the net accretion rate at the horizon is much lower than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate. At a distance of 1.16 kpc, Gaia BH2 is the second-nearest known BH, after Gaia BH1. Its orbit -- like that of Gaia BH1 -- seems too wide to have formed through common envelope evolution. Gaia BH1 and BH2 have orbital periods at opposite edges of the Gaia DR3 sensitivity curve, perhaps hinting at a bimodal intrinsic period distribution for wide BH binaries. Dormant BH binaries like Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2 likely significantly outnumber their close, X-ray bright cousins, but their formation pathways remain uncertain.},

The distance to each Cepheid was calculated using the period-luminosity relation for the Wesenheit magnitude, fitted to our data. The classical Cepheids in the LMC are situated mainly in the bar and in the northern arm. The eastern part of the LMC is closer to us and the plane fit to the whole LMC sample yields the inclination \$i=24.2{\textbackslash}pm0.7\$ deg and position angle \$\{{\textbackslash}rm P.A.\}=151.4{\textbackslash}pm1.7\$ deg. We redefined the LMC bar by extending it in the western direction and found no offset from the plane of the LMC contrary to previous studies. On the other hand, we found that the northern arm is offset from a plane by about \$-0.5\$ kpc, which was not observed before. The age distribution of the LMC Cepheids shows one maximum at about 100 Myr. We demonstrate that the SMC has a non-planar structure and can be described as an extended ellipsoid. We identified two large ellipsoidal off-axis structures in the SMC. The northern one is located closer to us and is younger, while the south-western is farther and older. The age distribution of the SMC Cepheids is bimodal with one maximum at 110 Myr, and another one at 220 Myr. Younger stars are located in the closer part of this galaxy while older ones are more distant. We classified nine Cepheids from our sample as Magellanic Bridge objects. These Cepheids show a large spread in three-dimensions although five of them form a connection between the Clouds. The closest one is closer than any of the LMC Cepheids, while the farthest one -- farther than any SMC Cepheid. All but one Cepheids in the Magellanic Bridge are younger than 300 Myr. The oldest one can be associated with the SMC Wing.},

	abstract = {Context.
              The
              XMM-Newton
              Survey Science Centre Consortium (SSC) develops software in close collaboration with the Science Operations Centre to perform a pipeline analysis of all
              XMM-Newton
              observations. In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of the
              XMM-Newton
              launch, the SSC has compiled the fourth generation of serendipitous source catalogues, 4XMM.
            
            
              Aims.
              The catalogue described here, 4XMM-DR9s, explores sky areas that were observed more than once by
              XMM-Newton
              . These observations are bundled in groups referred to as stacks. Stacking leads to a higher sensitivity, resulting in newly discovered sources and better constrained source parameters, and unveils long-term brightness variations.
            
            
              Methods.
              The 4XMM-DR9s catalogue was constructed from simultaneous source detection on overlapping observations. As a novel feature, positional rectification was applied beforehand. Observations with all filters and suitable camera settings were included. Exposures with a high background were discarded. The high-background thresholds were determined through a statistical analysis of all exposures in each instrument configuration. The X-ray background maps used in source detection were modelled via an adaptive smoothing procedure with newly determined parameters. Source fluxes were derived for all contributing observations, irrespective of whether the source would be detectable in an individual observation.
            
            
              Results.
              The new catalogue lists the X-ray sources detected in 1329 stacks with 6604 contributing observations over repeatedly covered 300 square degrees in the sky. Most stacks are composed of two observations, the largest one comprises 352 observations. We find 288 191 sources of which 218 283 were observed several times. The number of observations of a source ranges from 1 to 40. Auxiliary products, like X-ray full-band and false-colour images, long-term X-ray light curves, and optical finding charts, are published as well.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              4XMM-DR9s contains new detections and is considered a prime resource to explore long-term variability of X-ray sources discovered by
              XMM-Newton
              . Regular incremental releases, including new public observations, are planned.},

	abstract = {Double-line eclipsing binaries (DLEBs) have been recently used to constrain the amount of central mixing as a function of stellar mass, with contrasting results. In this work, we reanalyze the DLEB sample by Claret \& Torres, using a Bayesian method and new PARSEC tracks that account for both convective core overshooting and rotational mixing. Using overshooting alone we obtain that, for masses larger than about 1.9 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, the distribution of the overshooting parameter, \${\textbackslash}lambda\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ov\}\$, has a wide dispersion between 0.3 and 0.8, with essentially no values below \${\textbackslash}lambda\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ov\}=\$ 0.3 - 0.4. While the lower limit supports a mild convective overshooting efficiency, the large dispersion derived is difficult to explain in the framework of current models of that process, which leave little room for large randomness. We suggest that a simple interpretation of our results can be rotational mixing: different initial rotational velocities, in addition to a fixed amount of overshooting, could reproduce the high dispersion derived for intermediate-mass stars. After a reanalysis of the data, we find good agreement with models computed with fixed overshooting parameter, \${\textbackslash}lambda\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ov\}=0.4\$, and initial rotational rates, \${\textbackslash}omega\$, uniformly distributed in a wide range between \$0\$ and \$0.8\$ times the break-up value, at varying initial mass. We also find that our best-fitting models for the components of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ Aurigae and TZ Fornacis, agree with their observed rotational velocities, thus providing independent support to our hypothesis. We conclude that a constant efficiency of overshooting in concurrence with a star-to-star variation in the rotational mixing, might be crucial in the interpretation of such data.},

We use a Bayesian method based on new PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks with overshooting and rotation to obtain ages and initial rotation velocities of five well-studied Cepheids of the cluster. We find that four of the five Cepheids belong to an initially slowly rotating young population (of \$ 176 {\textbackslash}pm 5\$ Myr), while the fifth one is significantly older, either \$ 288 {\textbackslash}pm 20\$ Myr for models with high initial rotational velocity (\${\textbackslash}omega\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{i\} {\textbackslash}sim 0.9\$), or \$ 202 {\textbackslash}pm 5\$ Myr for slowly rotating models. The complementary analysis of the CMD rules out the latter solution while strongly supporting the presence of two distinct populations of \${\textbackslash}sim\$176 Myr and \${\textbackslash}sim\$288 Myr, respectively. Moreover, the observed multiple main sequences and the turn-offs indicate that the younger population is mainly made of slowly rotating stars, as is the case of the four younger Cepheids, while the older population is made mainly of initially fast rotating stars, as is the case of the fifth Cepheid. Our study not only reinforces the notion that some young clusters like NGC 1866 harbor multiple populations, but gives also hints that the first population, the older, may inherit the angular momentum from the parent cloud while stars of the second one, the younger, do not.},

	abstract = {Persistent monitoring of a spatiotemporal fluid process requires data sampling and predictive modeling of the process being monitored. In this paper we present PASST algorithm: Predictive-model based Adaptive Sampling of a Spatio-Temporal process. PASST is an adaptive robotic sampling algorithm that leverages predictive models to efficiently and persistently monitor a fluid process in a given region of interest. Our algorithm makes use of the predictions from a learned prediction model to plan a path for an autonomous vehicle to adaptively and efficiently survey the region of interest. In turn, the sampled data is used to obtain better predictions by giving an updated initial state to the predictive model. For predictive model, we use Knowledged-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to train models of fluid processes. These models are orders of magnitude smaller in size and run much faster than fluid data obtained from direct numerical simulations of the partial differential equations that describe the fluid processes or other comparable computational fluids models. For path planning, we use reinforcement learning based planning algorithms that use the field predictions as reward functions. We evaluate our adaptive sampling path planning algorithm on both numerically simulated fluid data and real-world nowcast ocean flow data to show that we can sample the spatiotemporal field in the given region of interest for long time horizons. We also evaluate PASST algorithm's generalization ability to sample from fluid processes that are not in the training repertoire of the learned models.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07324},
	abstract = {We present multi-epoch spectroscopic follow-up of a sample of ellipsoidal variables selected from Gaia DR3 as candidates for hosting quiescent black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). Our targets were identified as BH/NS candidates because their optical light curves -- when interpreted with models that attribute variability to tidal distortion of a star by a companion that contributes negligible light -- suggest that the companions are compact objects. From the likely BH/NS candidates identified in recent work accompanying Gaia DR3, we select 14 of the most promising targets for follow-up. We obtained spectra for each object at 2-10 epochs, strategically observing near conjunction to best-constrain the radial velocity semi-amplitude. From the measured semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves, we derive minimum companion masses of \$M\_\{2,{\textbackslash}min\} {\textbackslash}leq 0.5 {\textasciitilde} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ in all cases. Assuming random inclinations, the typical inferred companion mass is \$M\_2 {\textbackslash}sim 0.15 {\textasciitilde} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. This makes it unlikely that any of these systems contain a BH or NS, and we consider alternative explanations for the observed variability. We can best reproduce the observed light curves and radial velocities with models for unequal-mass contact binaries with starspots. Some of the objects in our sample may also be detached main-sequence binaries, or even single stars with pulsations or starspot variability masquerading as ellipsoidal variation. We provide recommendations for future spectroscopic efforts to further characterize this sample and more generally to search for compact object companions in close binaries.},

	abstract = {Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3) contains the second release of the combined radial velocities. It is based on the spectra collected during the first 34 months of the nominal mission. The longer time baseline and the improvements of the pipeline made it possible to push the processing limit, from Grvs = 12 in Gaia DR2, to Grvs = 14 mag. In this article, we describe the new functionalities implemented for Gaia DR3, the quality filters applied during processing and post-processing and the properties and performance of the published velocities. For Gaia DR3, several functionalities were upgraded or added. (Abridged) Gaia DR3 contains the combined radial velocities of 33 812 183 stars. With respect to Gaia DR2, the interval of temperature has been expanded from Teff {\textbackslash}in [3600, 6750] K to Teff {\textbackslash}in [3100, 14500] K for the bright stars ( Grvs {\textbackslash}leq 12 mag) and [3100, 6750] K for the fainter stars. The radial velocities sample a significant part of the Milky Way: they reach a few kilo-parsecs beyond the Galactic centre in the disc and up to about 10-15 kpc vertically into the inner halo. The median formal precision of the velocities is of 1.3 km/s at Grvs = 12 and 6.4 km/s at Grvs = 14 mag. The velocity zero point exhibits a small systematic trend with magnitude starting around Grvs = 11 mag and reaching about 400 m/s at Grvs = 14 mag. A correction formula is provided, which can be applied to the published data. The Gaia DR3 velocity scale is in satisfactory agreement with APOGEE, GALAH, GES and RAVE, with systematic differences that mostly do not exceed a few hundreds m/s. The properties of the radial velocities are also illustrated with specific objects: open clusters, globular clusters as well as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). For example, the precision of the data allows to map the line-of-sight rotational velocities of the globular cluster 47 Tuc and of the LMC.},

The inverse problem, obtaining orbital and stellar parameters given observational data, is more complicated and computationally expensive as it requires generating a large set of forward-models to determine which set of parameters and uncertainties best represent the available observational data. The process of determining the best solution and also of obtaining reliable and robust uncertainties on those parameters often requires the use of multiple algorithms, including both optimizers and samplers. Furthermore, the forward-model of PHOEBE has been designed to be as physically robust as possible, but is computationally expensive compared to other codes. It is useful, therefore, to use whichever code is most efficient given the reasonable assumptions for a specific system, but learning the intricacies of multiple codes presents a barrier to doing this in practice. Here we present the 2.3 release of PHOEBE (publicly available from http://phoebe-project.org) which introduces a general framework for defining and handling distributions on parameters, and utilizing multiple different estimation, optimization, and sampling algorithms. The presented framework supports multiple forward-models, including the robust model built into PHOEBE itself.},

            We present an extension of the BEER model for eccentric binaries – eBEER, approximating the BEaming, Ellipsoidal, and Reflection effects by harmonic series of the Keplerian elements of their orbit. As such, it can be a tool for fast processing of light curves for detecting non-eclipsing eccentric binary systems. To validate the applicability of the eccentric model and its approximations, we applied eBEER to the Kepler light curves, identified a sample of bright non-eclipsing binary candidates, and followed three of them with the Wise observatory eShel spectrograph. After confirming the three systems are indeed radial velocity (RV) binaries, we fitted the light curves and the RV data with PHOEBE, a detailed numerical light curve and RV model, and showed that the PHOEBE derived parameters are similar to those obtained by the eBEER approximation.},

            This is the second of a series of papers that focuses on searching large sets of photometric light curves for evidence of close binaries with a dormant black hole, and, in some cases, a dormant neutron star. The detection of such a binary is based on identifying a star that displays a large ellipsoidal periodic modulation, induced by tidal interaction with its companion. Based on the observed ellipsoidal amplitude and the primary mass and radius, one can derive a minimum mass ratio of the binary. A binary with a minimum mass ratio significantly larger than unity might be a candidate for having a dormant compact-object companion. Unfortunately, the photometric search is hampered by the fact that in many cases the primary mass and radius are not well known. In this paper we present a simple approach that circumvents this problem by suggesting a robust modified minimum mass ratio, assuming the primary fills its Roche lobe. The newly defined modified minimum mass ratio is always smaller than the minimum mass ratio, which is, in its turn, smaller than the actual mass ratio. Therefore, binaries with a modified minimum mass ratio larger than unity are candidates for having a compact-object secondary.},

            This is the third of a series of papers that presents an algorithm to search for close binaries with massive, possibly compact, unseen secondaries. The detection of such a binary is based on identifying a star that displays a large ellipsoidal periodic modulation, induced by tidal interaction with its companion. In the second paper of the series, we presented a simple approach to derive a robust modified minimum mass ratio (mMMR), based on the observed ellipsoidal amplitude, without knowing the primary mass and radius, assuming the primary fills its Roche lobe. The newly defined mMMR is always smaller than the actual mass ratio. Therefore, a binary with an mMMR larger than unity is a good candidate for having a massive secondary, which might be a black hole or a neutron star. This paper considers 10 956 OGLE short-period ellipsoidals observed towards the Galactic bulge. We re-analyse their modulation and identify 136 main-sequence systems with mMMR significantly larger than unity as candidates for having compact-object secondaries, assuming their observed periodic modulations reflect indeed the ellipsoidal effect. Obviously, one needs follow-up observations to find out the true nature of these companions.},

	abstract = {The Galactic Legacy Infrared Midplane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE), is a survey of Galactic Plane central parts made with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). It covers approximately 220 square degrees, between galactic longitudes Â±65° and Â±1° in galactic latitude (up to 4.2° in the central parts). The four IRAC bands are centered at approximately 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0μm. The GLIMPSE combines the 3 surveys: * GLIMPSE-I covers the longitude ranges {\textbar}l{\textbar}=10--65° and the latitude range {\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textless}=1° (Benjamin et al. 2003PASP..115..953B) * GLIMPSE-II covers the longitude range of {\textbar}l{\textbar}{\textless}=10°, and a latitude range {\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textless}=1° from {\textbar}l{\textbar}=5--10, {\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textless}=1.5 for {\textbar}l{\textbar}=2--5, and {\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textless}=2° for {\textbar}l{\textbar}{\textless}=2. GLIMPSE-II coverage excludes the Galactic center region {\textbar}l{\textbar}{\textless}=1, {\textbar}b{\textbar}{\textless}=0.75 observed by the GALCEN GO program (PID=3677). * GLIMPSE-3D adds vertical extensions up to {\textbar}b{\textbar}=4.2° near the galactic center, and up to {\textbar}b{\textbar}=3° in selected other parts of the Galaxy (+/-10, 18.5, 25, 30, and -15 (345)°). GLIMPSE-II had two-epoch coverage for a total of three visits on the sky. The observations consisted of two 1.2 second integrations at each position in the first epoch of data taking (September 2005) and a single 1.2 second integration at each position six months later (April 2006). The highly reliable v2.0 GLIMPSEII Catalog (v2.0\_GLMIIC) consists of point sources that are detected at least twice in one band and at least once in an adjacent band and a S/N {\textgreater} 5 cut for the band with the two detections. There are also faint and bright flux limits on the Catalog entries. The more complete v2.0 Archive (v2.0\_GLMIIA) has less stringent criteria, namely two detections in any bands, those detections having a S/N {\textgreater} 5. The IRAC data were bandmerged with the 2MASS All-Sky Point Source Catalog. See the GLIMPSEII v2.0 Data Products \& Data Delivery document for more details. The catalog available from CDS merges the 3 surveys GLIMPSE-I (v2.0), GLIMPSE-II (v2.0), and GLIMPSE-3D; Catalog and Archive records are also merged here. In the regions of overlap between the 3 surveys (e.g. longitude around 10°) preference was given to (1) GLIMPSE-II, as recommended in the GLIMPSE documents of May 2007 (glimpse1\_v2.0.pdf) and April 2008 (glimpse2-v2.0.pdf); (2) GLIMPSE-I, and (3) GLIMPSE-3D sources. Sources from different surveys were merged if their position is closer than 0.1arcsec.

	abstract = {The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) provides a unique laboratory for the study of the lifecycle of dust given its low metallicity ({\textasciitilde}1/5 solar) and relative proximity ({\textasciitilde}60 kpc). This motivated the SAGE-SMC (Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution in the Tidally Stripped, Low Metallicity Small Magellanic Cloud) Spitzer Legacy program with the specific goals of studying the amount and type of dust in the present interstellar medium, the sources of dust in the winds of evolved stars, and how much dust is consumed in star formation. This program mapped the full SMC (30 deg2) including the body, wing, and tail in seven bands from 3.6 to 160 μm using IRAC and MIPS on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The data were reduced and mosaicked, and the point sources were measured using customized routines specific for large surveys. We have made the resulting mosaics and point-source catalogs available to the community. The infrared colors of the SMC are compared to those of other nearby galaxies and the 8 μm/24 μm ratio is somewhat lower than the average and the 70 μm/160 μm ratio is somewhat higher than the average. The global infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) shows that the SMC has approximately 1/3 the aromatic emission/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon abundance of most nearby galaxies. Infrared color-magnitude diagrams are given illustrating the distribution of different asymptotic giant branch stars and the locations of young stellar objects. Finally, the average SED of H II/star formation regions is compared to the equivalent Large Magellanic Cloud average H II/star formation region SED. These preliminary results will be expanded in detail in subsequent papers.},
